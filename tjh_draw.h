////// DEPENDENCIES ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
// This single header library relies on the following:
//
// Programable pipline OpenGL. You can load all your OpenGL functions with a
// library like glew.h. See here for more http://glew.sourceforge.net/

////// README //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
// USAGE:
//
//  1) #define TJH_DRAW_IMPLEMENTATION then #include this file in *ONE*
//  .cpp file in your project.
//
//  2) Call `Draw::init()` somewhere after you have setup your OpenGL context.
//  Beware this library will not setup an OpenGL context for you! You should
//  create one yourself, or use my handy TJH_WINDOW library if you like :)
//  
//  3) Call `Draw::shutdown()` somewhere before you have destroyed your OpenGL
//  context.
//
//  4) #include this file in all the files that want to draw stuff
//
//  5) Call `Draw::quad()` and such to  draw the things, then call `Draw::flush()`
//  as the last thing you do to ensure everything is written
//

////// LIBRARY OPTIONS /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
// You can modify the following #defines to enable or disable additional library
// features.
//

// If defined this file will include SDL.h

// If defined this file will include glew.h
#ifndef TJH_DRAW_INCLUDE_GLEW
#define TJH_DRAW_INCLUDE_GLEW 1

// IMPORTANT: If you want this to include glew for your, you will need to set these correctly

////// TODO ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
//  - convert line() to use triangles, optional settable width
//
//  Actually maybe just rethink the ortho matrix stuff...
//  - make it possible to pass a pointer to a custom ortho matrix
//  - test setOrthoMatrix x_offset and y_offset
//      - i implemented something along those lines but i don't know if it actually works
//
//  - solid shapes have a line draw mode
//      - when drawing shapes in line mode, lines expand inwards to preserve specified size
//  - pointSize would be nice to have
//  - 3d quad from point, normal, width, height
//  - 3d textured quad
//  - 3d circle from point, line, radius
//  - 3d sphere
//  - 3d cylinder
//  - 3d line
//  - setWireframe toggle wireframe rendering for at least all the 2d stuff
//      - wireframes should also respond to lineWidth
//      - wireframes should work with textured draw calls
//      - how they work in 3d will be more complicated
//  - setOrtho matrix and setMVP matrix should flush the vertex_buffer
//      - that way you can set the ortho and mvp whenever you want and everything after
//        it will use whatever was last set
//  - ditch flush !!! 
//      - just call the functions whenever and it will render immidiately
//      - let the user choose either to use begin() and end() which will cache the verts in
//        in the buffer till the end
//      - also flush is problematic because you might never call it and run out of memory!
//  - If i want to not clobber the GL state then there will need to be a begin() function
//    stores any state that the renderer will change and stores is on end (end should also flush)
//
// From tjh_window.h
//
// - choose requested opengl version
// - set fullscreen state
// - optional antialiasing
// - make is so you don't need to modify this file to change the #defines
//   have them check to see if they are already defined first
